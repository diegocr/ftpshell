Requires:     asyncio.library

FTPShell  is a FTP Client which tend to be run like another shell, it could
look  like  all  other  those  tools from the Linux platfirm which does the
same,  but  it  is  not!,  it  have  been created from scratch being a pure
AmigaOS  program,  just  check  the  benchmarks  section and you'll see for
yourself :-)

Available commands:
        ls              list            dir             quit    
        exit            cd              cwd             put     
        get             raw     

ls, dir and list is the same, as for quit and exit, or cd and cwd

To download files use the get command, and put command to upload.

using  ls,  dir or list, receives the ftp server's filelisting and ftpshell
pre-process  it  to  print  it  to  you  using a own formatting (similar to
AmigaDOS's  list  command),  if you want no such formatting (or if ftpshell
report  some  problem),  using  'ls  -l' will return the server filelisting
as-is.

==============================================================

 - By default, complete directories are downloaded or 
uploaded recursively.

 - Supports hardlinks and softlinks, for both, files and dirs.

 - Partial 64bits support. You can download a directory which
has a size of 1TB (one terabyte), but no single files higher 
than 2GB (thats a limitation of our AmigaOS 3.x ...)

 - By default, timestamps are respected, downloading or 
uploading, on whatever you transfer the file's time will be 
keep according to the machine (not when you dl/ul them)

 - The faster FTP Client available for AmigaOS :-)

benchmarks running on A1200 060, transfering a RAR compressed
file of about 20MB from/to a SFS 1.254 partition.

Speeds was calculated by average meter from 50% of the 
transfered size to the end.

We recommend to use Genesis, for obvious reasons.

Also, I've developed this program *just* for me being able to 
transfers files from my miggy to the PeeCee (or viceversa) as
fast as possible, if you have problems using it with remote
server(s) it is not my problem ;-D
